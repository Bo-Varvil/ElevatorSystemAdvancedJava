# ElevatorSystemAdvancedJava
Advanced Java Application Programming Final Project

To display our knowledge and competence with the topics covered in the course, we were tasked with creating a project that covered at least three (3) of the topics discussed in the course. Those topics were: Generics, Multithreading, Netowrking, GUI Programming, JSP, Databases, and Servlets.

For our project, we are going to cover multithreading, GUI programming and one other topic undecided at this point. Our project will simulate a set of elevators, where each elevator is its own thread, and has to communicate with the other elevators to determine which will move when called. The interface will be a JavaFX GUI, which will hopefully have animations and interactivity.
